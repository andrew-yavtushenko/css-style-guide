#Style guides for CSS code

##Basics

1. Horizontal indents (tabs) should be made by spaces (soft-tabs), one indent â€“ two spaces
2. All blocks of rules should be vertically indented with one line
3. Selector name and opening curly brace should be separated with space

``` css
.my-class {
  width: 100px;
  height: 300px;
}
```
